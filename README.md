## Green Data for Health (GD4H) 

GD4H is a service offering incubated within ECOLAB, the innovation laboratory for ecological transition of the General Commission for Sustainable Development.
It organizes a challenge to foster the development of tools rooted in the health-environment data community in order to address shared issues.

## Project Description 

Air quality has an impact on health. Indoor air quality (IAQ) and outdoor air quality (OAQ) data are generated by different stakeholders, on different geographical and temporal scales, and are therefore not linked easily, thus limiting the interpretations that can be made from IAQ measurements.

Goal : How can we retrieve OAQ data for spatial and temporal matching with IAQ data? What are the relationships between pollutant concentrations in IAQ and OAQ?

The objective was to retrieve these data (OAQ: Géod’Air and AAQSA, traffic, weather, Corine Land Cover, graphical parcel registry...) automatically and link them to the buildings of interest to the CSTB. Challenge participants have to propose methods for automated retrieval of open data (algorithm, API), reliability verification (cleaning, handling missing data), and an algorithm to link these data to a given timeframe for a sample of buildings.

## My contribution

I extracted outdoor air pollutions from simulations and linked them to buildings coordinates where indoor air quality measurement campaigns were conducted.

My notebook can be found [**here**](https://github.com/ctherreau/api2build/tree/main/project/notebooks/Sprint_1/ChimereCSTBmatching)

The matching methods between outdoor air pollutions and indooor measurements are described in the following diagram :
